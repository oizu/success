    <h4>Limitation of liability</h4>
    <div>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the Operator, its affiliates, directors,
      officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect, incidental, special,
      punitive, cover or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, revenue, sales,
      goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business interruption, loss of anticipated savings, loss of business
      opportunity) however caused, under any theory of liability, including, without limitation, contract, tort,
      warranty,
      breach of statutory duty, negligence or otherwise, even if the liable party has been advised as to the possibility
      of such damages or could have foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the
      aggregate liability of the Operator and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors
      relating to the services will be limited to an amount no greater than one dollar or any amounts actually paid in
      cash by you to the Operator for the prior one month period prior to the first event or occurrence giving rise to
      such liability. The limitations and exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any
      losses or fails of its essential purpose.
    </div>

    <h4>Indemnification</h4>
    <div>You agree to indemnify and hold the Operator and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
      suppliers and licensors harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages or costs, including reasonable
      attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with or arising from any third party allegations, claims, actions,
      disputes,
      or demands asserted against any of them as a result of or relating to your Content, your use of the Website and
      Services or any willful misconduct on your part.
    </div>

    <h4>Severability</h4>
    <div>All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and binding
      only
      to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the extent necessary
      so
      that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any
      provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
      jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall
      constitute
      their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof
      shall remain in full force and effect.
    </div>

    <h4>Arbitration Agreement & Waiver Of Certain Rights (US)</h4>
    <div>
      This section shall only apply to Users located in the United States of America.

      Except as set forth hereinabove, you and we agree that we will resolve any disputes between us (including any
      disputes between you and a third-party agent of ours) through binding and final arbitration instead of through
      court
      proceedings. You and we hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim (defined below). All controversies,
      claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and us or you and a third-party agent of ours (each a
      “Claim”) shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration
      Association (“AAA Rules”). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator’s
      decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of
      competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the arbitration proceedings will be kept confidential and that the
      existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other
      documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed
      beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the
      arbitration, by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other
      governmental agencies, or as specifically permitted by state law. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal
      arbitration law apply to this agreement. However, the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or
      agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability,
      enforceability, or formation of these Terms of Service including, but not limited to, a claim that all or any part
      of these Terms of Service is void or voidable.

      If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we
      will
      pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator’s fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems
      necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may
      apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the
      arbitrator deems appropriate.

      This arbitration agreement under this section does not preclude either party from seeking action by federal,
      state,
      or local government agencies. You and we also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In
      addition, you and we retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief,
      including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed
      incompatible
      with these Terms of Service, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in
      these Terms of Service.

      Neither you nor we may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a
      class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis.
      The
      arbitrator can decide only your and/or our individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the
      claims
      of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. The arbitrator may award in the arbitration the same
      damages or other relief available under applicable law, including injunctive and declaratory relief, as if the
      action were brought in court on an individual basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or
      herein, the arbitrator may not issue a “public injunction” and any such “public injunction” may be awarded only by
      a
      federal or state court. If either party seeks a “public injunction,” all other claims and prayers for relief must
      be
      adjudicated in arbitration first and any prayer or claim for a “public injunction” in federal or state court
      stayed
      until the arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can adjudicate the party’s claim or
      prayer for “public injunctive relief.” In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under principles of claim
      or
      issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.

      If any provision of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of
      no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and
      effect.
      No waiver of any provision of this Section of the Terms of Service will be effective or enforceable unless
      recorded
      in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any
      other portion of this Terms of Service. This Section of the Terms will survive the termination of your
      relationship
      with us.

      THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE
      RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS
      PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR WE WOULD
      HAVE
      IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
    </div>
    <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
    <div>
      These Terms of Service, your use of this Website, and the relationship between you and us shall be governed by the
      laws of the Republic of Cyprus, without regard to conflict of law rules. Nothing contained in these Terms of
      Service
      shall constitute an agreement to the application of the laws of any other nation to this Website. You agree that
      this Website shall be deemed a passive Website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either
      specific or general, in jurisdictions other than the Republic of Cyprus. The sole and exclusive jurisdiction and

      court located in Limassol, Cyprus. You hereby submit to the jurisdiction and venue of said Courts.

      No waiver by us of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or
      continuing
      waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure by us to assert a
      right
      or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

      If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity
      of
      such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall
      remain in full force and effect.

      We may terminate these Terms of Service for any or no reason at any time by notifying you through a notice on this
      Website, by email, or by any other method of communication. Any such termination will be without prejudice to our
      rights, remedies, claims, or defenses hereunder. Upon termination of the Terms of Service, you will no longer have
      a
      right to access your account or your Content. We will not have any obligation to assist you in migrating your data
